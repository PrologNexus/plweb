## SWI-Prolog version 9.2

The SWI-Prolog 9.2 is the latest stable release.  Highlights:

  - Bundled Python bi-directional interface (Janus)
  - C++ interface version 2 (`SWI-ccp2.h`) covers much more
    of the SWI-Prolog C API and is more (type-)safe.
  - Sources are now strict C11 and may be compiled using
    e.g. VS2022 on Windows.
  - Many improvements to the tooling.
    - The profiler can provide accurate port counts
    - The coverage analysis tool can annotate files by line
      and collect data from multiple threads and Prolog runs.
    - The unit testing tool supports concurrent testing and
      hiding of output of succeeded tests.
    - The pack manager can deal with version and feature
      restrictions, plan multiple packs together, build using
      CMake.
  - Added an option for commandline tools that can be called
    as ``swipl <tool> [arg ...]``.  Provides cli tools for
    pack management and `.qlf` compilation.
